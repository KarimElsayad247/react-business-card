# React Business Card

First Solo-Project of the Scrimba react course. A simple static site. An exercise in writing jsx.

It doesn't use hooks or any of these react features.

# Live

The docs folder contains the productoin version of the site, not docs. It's a nice hack to allow the site to be hosted on github pages.
